yamltk - yaml toolkit merges yaml and transforms bash variables to yaml

USAGE
    yamltk [OPTION].. PATH..

       -c       check source
       -h       help
       -v       version
       -x       use filename extensions as special
       -m       output is xml

  USAGE EXAMPLES
    Merge ..
           yamltk ./*yml > merged.yml

    Check that these files have proper syntax
           yamltk -c ./*yml

    Merge in a special kind of way:
           # cat houses.var
           These are all houses.
           They are really cool houses.
           # cat notes.yml
           ---
           NAME: A great place to start
           DESCRIPTION: I am without a doubt, descriptive.

           # yamltk -x houses.var notes.yml
           ---
           DESCRIPTION: 'I am without a doubt, descriptive.'
           NAME: A great place to start
           houses: |-
             These are all houses.
             They are really cool houses.

   SPECIAL EXTENSIONS
    If you want to treat extensions as special, use the -x option flag.

    If you use these, the filenames dictate how the data is merged.

    The data is merged into a master hash. If the filename to merge from has
    the string 'var', the file data is inserted into the master hash with
    the key 'houses' for a filename of 'houses.var'

       yamltk houses.var

    If the data is yaml, it will be inserted- if it is not yaml, it is
    inserted as scalar.

    This is primarily being used to create data for use with tmpltk

    Also in this distribution:

CAVEATS
    Being used in production- but still in alpha. Please contact the AUTHOR
    for any suggestions, etc.

TODO
    This should take in bash variables and be able to turn into YAML. For
    example, if the input is 'set' putput, should be able to make that into
    yaml output.
